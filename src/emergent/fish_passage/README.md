============

Minimal scaffold demonstrating coding policies:

- Small, focused functions
- Bounded loops with explicit assertions
- Startup-only allocation example
- Minimal defensive handling and clear assertions

Functions:

- `compute_travel_times(distances, speed)` — computes travel times with input validation.
- `summarize_times(times)` — returns (min, max) for a times list.
