Preamble/Module plan for physiological scaling and swim modes.

Responsibilities (planned):
- Scale behavioral parameters by body length, model swim modes (burst, sustained), and fatigue thresholds.
- Functions:
  - `scale_by_body_length(value, body_length)`
  - `mode_switch(agent, conditions)`
  - `compute_fatigue_thresholds(agent)`

Notes:
- Keep functions small and document assumptions; suitable for unit testing.
