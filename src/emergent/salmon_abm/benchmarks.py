benchmarks.py

Preamble/Module plan for performance microbenchmarks.

Responsibilities (planned):
- Simple timing harnesses for hot kernels (KDTree builds, raster ops, numba kernels).
- Produce reproducible reports to `benchmarks/` for performance tuning.

Notes:
- Benchmarks should be small and reproducible; provide default inputs for CI-like runs.
