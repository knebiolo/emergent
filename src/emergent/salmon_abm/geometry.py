geometry.py

Preamble/Module plan for geometric utilities.

Responsibilities (planned):
- Functions for coordinate transforms, pixel<->geo conversions, affine computations.
- Utilities for perimeter simplification, point-in-polygon checks, and centerline derivation helpers.
- Small helpers should be pure functions with clear input validation and documented bounds.

Notes:
- Keep functions short (<60 lines) and well-tested.
