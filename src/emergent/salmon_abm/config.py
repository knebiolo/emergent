config.py

Preamble/Module plan for central configuration and constants.

Responsibilities (planned):
- Central place for tunable constants (max_agents, buffer sizes, default seeds).
- Feature flags for assertion density, NASA-aspirational checks, and optional heavy dependencies.

Notes:
- Keep values explicit and documented; prefer numeric defaults with units in comments.
