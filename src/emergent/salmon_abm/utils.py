utils.py

Preamble/Module plan for small utility helpers used across the Salmon ABM.

Responsibilities (planned):
- Robust logging helpers like `_safe_log_exception` used consistently across modules.
- Small numeric helpers, KDTree builders, and resource-aware array utilities.
- Central place for configuration constants (max agents, buffer sizes) that can be tuned.

Notes:
- Follow the project's coding guide: small functions, clear names, minimal defensive wrappers.
