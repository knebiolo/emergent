**Status**: üü° Partially Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## üü° IN PROGRESS

### Wind System - 12.5% Working (1/8 harbors)
**Status**: Coordinate handling fixed, but additional issues discovered

#### Working Harbors:
- ‚úÖ **Galveston (NGOFS2)**: 30.3s load time
  - Uses 1D station coordinates (x, y, lon, lat)
  - Spatial variation confirmed: 3.0 m/s U range, 1.8 m/s speed range
  - KDTree interpolation working correctly
  - Variables: `uwind_speed`, `vwind_speed`

#### Issues Found:
1. **Baltimore (CBOFS)** - KDTree Index Error
   - Problem: Uses 2D ROMS-style coordinates (`lon_rho`, `lat_rho`)
   - Error: "index 172 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 61"
   - Cause: KDTree built on 2D grid but indexing mismatched with cropped data
   - Fix needed: Handle 2D coordinates in `build_wind_sampler()` in `atmospheric.py`
   - Variables: `Uwind`, `Vwind` (different naming than NGOFS2!)

2. **ERA5 Data Access** - 403 Forbidden
   - AWS S3 bucket `era5-pds` requires authentication
   - Fallback logic catches this correctly
   - Not critical since NOAA OFS fallback works

3. **HRRR Data Access** - Not tested yet
   - May have date/time issues (files only kept ~14 days)
   - May also require authentication
   - Fallback to ERA5 then NOAA OFS should handle this

4. **Remaining Harbors** - Not yet tested:
   - ‚ùì Los Angeles (WCOFS)
   - ‚ùì New Orleans (NGOFS2) - Should work like Galveston
   - ‚ùì New York (NYOFS)
   - ‚ùì San Francisco Bay (SFBOFS)
   - ‚ùì Rosario Strait (SSCOFS)
   - ‚ùì Seattle (SSCOFS)

## üìã HIGH PRIORITY TODO

### 1. Test Galveston Ship Simulation üéØ **NEXT STEP**
**Timeline**: Now (October 2, 2025)  
**Files**: `scripts/run_ship.py` or create new test script  
**Goal**: Validate end-to-end simulation with currents + winds

**Test Parameters**:
- Harbor: Galveston (only fully working wind+current harbor)
- Number of ships: 2-5 (small test)
- Duration: 1-2 hours simulated time
- Timestep: 1-10 seconds
- Environmental forcing: Both currents (NGOFS2) + winds (NGOFS2 stations)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Ships spawn correctly
- [ ] Ships respond to current drift
- [ ] Ships respond to wind drift
- [ ] COLREGS collision avoidance works
- [ ] PID controllers compensate for drift
- [ ] No crashes or errors
- [ ] Reasonable computation time (<5 min real time per 1 hour sim time)

**Validation Checks**:
- Check that `current_fn()` returns non-zero values
- Check that `wind_fn()` returns non-zero values (we see 5.078 m/s wind in tests)
- Verify ship tracks show drift compensation
- Monitor console for environmental forcing debug output

---

### 2. Fix Baltimore Wind KDTree Issue
**Timeline**: After Galveston simulation succeeds  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

**Problem**: 2D ROMS coordinates cause dimension mismatch in KDTree indexing

**Solution Approach**:
```python
# In atmospheric.py, build_wind_sampler():
# Check if lon/lat are 2D (ROMS grid) vs 1D (stations)
if lon.ndim == 2:
    # Flatten for KDTree but track original shape
    lon_flat = lon.ravel()
    lat_flat = lat.ravel()
    tree = cKDTree(np.column_stack((lon_flat, lat_flat)))
    # Index into flattened arrays
else:
    # Existing 1D station logic
    tree = cKDTree(np.column_stack((lon, lat)))
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/emergent/ship_abm/atmospheric.py` lines ~120-180 in `build_wind_sampler()`

**Testing**:
- Run `test_all_harbors_wind.py` after fix
- Baltimore should work
- Galveston should still work

---

### 3. Complete Wind Testing for All Harbors
**Timeline**: After Baltimore fix  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours (mostly wait time for S3 downloads)

**Remaining Tests**:
- [ ] Los Angeles (WCOFS) - May use 2D ROMS coords
- [ ] New Orleans (NGOFS2) - Should work like Galveston
- [ ] New York (NYOFS) - May not have station files
- [ ] San Francisco Bay (SFBOFS) - Unknown
- [ ] Rosario Strait (SSCOFS) - Unknown  
- [ ] Seattle (SSCOFS) - Same model as Rosario

**Expected Outcomes**:
- NGOFS2 harbors (New Orleans) should work immediately
- ROMS harbors (LA) need Baltimore fix first
- Some harbors may not have MET/stations files ‚Üí fallback to uniform wind

---

### 4. Wind Fallback Strategy (if HRRR/ERA5/NOAA fail)
**Timeline**: As needed  
**Priority**: Low-Medium

**Options**:
1. **Uniform Wind Field**: Single wind value for entire domain
   - Simplest fallback
   - No spatial variation
   - Could use NOAA buoy data or weather station

2. **Synthetic Wind Model**: 
   - Generate wind field based on pressure gradients
   - More realistic but complex

3. **Historical Climatology**:
   - Pre-computed average wind fields by month/season
   - Static but better than nothing

**Recommendation**: Start with option 1 (uniform wind) for harbors without station data

---

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY TODO

### 5. Performance Optimization
**Timeline**: After all harbors working  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours

**Caching System**:
- [ ] Cache downloaded netCDF datasets to disk
- [ ] Check cache before S3 download
- [ ] Implement cache expiration (24-48 hours for forecasts)
- [ ] Reduce redundant downloads for multi-hour simulations

**Time Interpolation**:
- [ ] Currently using nearest-hour (no interpolation)
- [ ] Implement linear interpolation between forecast hours
- [ ] Smoother transitions for long simulations

**Spatial Interpolation**:
- [ ] Consider bilinear for ROMS structured grids (vs nearest-neighbor)
- [ ] May improve accuracy near coastlines
- [ ] Profile performance impact

**Expected Gains**:
- First run: 30-120s (download + process)
- Subsequent runs: <5s (cache hit)
- Multi-hour sims: 1 download for entire time range

---

### 6. Add More Harbors
**Timeline**: As needed for specific studies  
**Priority**: Low-Medium

**Candidates**:
- [ ] Houston Ship Channel (Texas)
- [ ] Port of Savannah (Georgia)
- [ ] Port of Long Beach (California) - separate from LA
- [ ] Columbia River (Oregon/Washington)
- [ ] Mobile Bay (Alabama)
- [ ] San Diego (California)

**Process**:
1. Add bounds to `config.py` SIMULATION_BOUNDS
2. Identify NOAA OFS model coverage (check CO-OPS website)
3. Add to OFS_MODEL_MAP
4. Test with `test_all_harbors.py` and `test_all_harbors_wind.py`

---

### 7. Visualization Enhancements
**Timeline**: After simulations running smoothly  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 4-8 hours

**Vector Field Overlay**:
- [ ] Show current vectors on ship viewer
- [ ] Show wind vectors on ship viewer
- [ ] Color code by magnitude
- [ ] Update in real-time during simulation

**Ship Tracks**:
- [ ] Plot historical track with color gradient (time)
- [ ] Show planned path vs actual path (drift effects)
- [ ] Export tracks to GeoJSON/Shapefile

**Environmental Data Inspector**:
- [ ] Click on map to query current/wind at that location
- [ ] Time series plots of environmental forcing
- [ ] Statistics panel (min/max/mean current speed, wind speed)

---

## üìã LOW PRIORITY TODO

### 8. Documentation
**Timeline**: Ongoing  
**Priority**: Low

- [ ] Document file naming conventions (NOAA OFS models)
- [ ] API documentation for `get_current_fn()` and `wind_sampler()`
- [ ] Example notebooks for common use cases
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for S3 access issues

---

### 9. Unit Tests
**Timeline**: After system stabilizes  
**Priority**: Low

- [ ] Test ROMS grid handler
- [ ] Test FVCOM grid handler  
- [ ] Test KDTree interpolation accuracy
- [ ] Test fallback logic (regional ‚Üí RTOFS ‚Üí tidal proxy)
- [ ] Test wind coordinate handling (1D vs 2D)

---

### 10. Advanced Features
**Timeline**: Future enhancements  
**Priority**: Low

**Waves**:
- [ ] Add wave height/period/direction from WaveWatch III
- [ ] Impact on ship motion (additional forcing)

**Ice**:
- [ ] Add sea ice concentration for Arctic simulations
- [ ] Ship performance degradation in ice

**Tides**:
- [ ] Replace tidal proxy with NOAA CO-OPS tidal constituents
- [ ] More accurate for harbors without OFS coverage

**Weather**:
- [ ] Add visibility, precipitation
- [ ] Impact on navigation decisions

---

## üîß KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical (Blocking):
- None currently - Galveston simulation ready to test!

### High Priority:
1. **Baltimore Wind KDTree Error** (see TODO #2)
2. **ERA5 Access** - 403 Forbidden (non-blocking, fallback works)

### Medium Priority:
3. **WCOFS Surface Files** - Only u_sur/v_sur, no 3D data
4. **NYOFS Availability** - Limited recent data, falls back to tidal proxy
5. **Wind Variable Names** - Not standardized (uwind_speed vs Uwind vs u10)

### Low Priority:
6. **Load Times** - 5-120s depending on model/harbor (acceptable but could cache)
7. **No Spatial Variation** - Some harbors only have 1-2 stations (uniform wind)
