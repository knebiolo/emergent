# emergent
Python software using agent based models to solve complex spatial problems.  This software was written alongside my dissertation (Nebiolo 2017).   

## Agent Based Models
ABMs are a collection of autonomous, goal directed software objects, capable of interacting with other agents, reacting to their environment, and making decisions that maximize their own well being.

ABMs simulate complex adaptive systems, what we see as random movement is not.  There are no stochastic processes in these models other than setting intial states.  Movement therefore is chaotic, once the simulation starts the agents are making decisions on their own - we cannot predict their behavior, it has to unfold.  The goal of these applications is to produce self organized emergent behavior of interest to managers.  Emergence results from individual interaction governed by simple behavioral rules.  Traffic jams the result of congestion, not construction or an accident, are an example of emergence and are known as kinematic waves in the literature.
